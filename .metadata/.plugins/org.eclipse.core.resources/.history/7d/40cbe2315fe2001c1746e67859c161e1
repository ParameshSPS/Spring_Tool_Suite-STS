Spring Cloud
------------

It gives you many different libraries for implementing micro service using springs

1. openFegin
		It is used to make REST calls
		
Steps to use openFegin:
-----------------------
 1. Add dependency in pom.xml
 2. Create an interface with method matching signature of remote method
 3. Enable feign client 

 ----------------------------------------
 
 1) we want assign unique name to every microservice and use that name to refer that microservice.
 It is by using
 
 2) Eureke : It service registry and discovery server.
 			Every microservice register itsself with Eureke
 			Eureka server typically runs in port 8761
 			
 			
----------------------------
 	
3) API gateway

	This is used to navigate calls to microservices.
	All calls are first made to api gateway and then api gateway will route call to repsective microservice.

	Client should never ever call to any microservice directly. Call should be routed through API gateway always.

-----------------------------------

4) Circuit breaker

	Circuit breaker is used in microservices to handle failure of services.
	It is implemented using a library given by spring cloud called known as resilince4j.

-----------------------------------

5) Cloud config server

It is a centralized application that massage all the application related properties
